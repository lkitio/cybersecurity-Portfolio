a security-focused technologist with a passion for designing, automating, and optimizing secure software delivery workflows. With expertise in CI/CD pipelines, container orchestration (Kubernetes, Docker), and cloud engineering (Azure, AWS, GCP), I'm dedicated to driving DevOps best practices and collaboration.
About Me
8+ years of experience in DevSecOps, DevOps, and software engineering
Proven track record of implementing secure and scalable cloud infrastructure, automating CI/CD pipelines, and optimizing workflows for efficient software delivery
Skilled in cloud engineering, infrastructure as code (Terraform, CloudFormation), CI/CD tools (Jenkins, GitLab CI/CD), and security practices (security automation, threat modeling, vulnerability assessment)


## Career Objectives:
### Cybersecurity:
Leverage my DevOps experience and passion for cybersecurity to secure a role as a Tier 1 Analyst in a Security Operations Center (SOC), where I can utilize my skills to identify and mitigate threats, and contribute to the development of proactive security measures.
Expand my expertise in security automation, threat modeling, vulnerability assessment, and incident response to become a subject matter expert in cybersecurity.
### Software Development:
Apply my knowledge of DevSecOps principles to ensure the secure development of software applications, from design to deployment.
Continuously improve my programming skills in languages such as Python, C++, and Java, and stay up-to-date with the latest software development trends and technologies.
Collaborate with cross-functional teams to integrate security best practices into the SDLC, preventing vulnerabilities and ensuring the delivery of secure software products.
### Why:
As a former DevOps engineer, I've faced numerous security challenges that have driven my passion for cybersecurity. By transitioning into DevSecOps, I've gained a deeper understanding of the importance of integrating security into every stage of the software development lifecycle. Now, I'm eager to bring my unique blend of DevOps and cybersecurity expertise to a SOC team, where I can make a meaningful impact in protecting against threats and vulnerabilities.
This objective highlights your:
Career aspirations in cybersecurity and software development
Relevant experience and skills in DevOps and DevSecOps
Passion for security and commitment to continuous learning
Desire to leverage your expertise to make a positive impact in a SOC team
